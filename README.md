#NVD Assessment RDB

This project is a web application that fetches, stores, and displays CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) API. It provides a user interface to browse and filter CVEs, and an API for programmatic access. This README addresses all requirements outlined in the original assessment document.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip
*   A PostgreSQL database (for deployment; see note below about local setup)
*   Docker (optional, but recommended for local development)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd nvd_assessment
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Create a `.env` file:**  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add the following line, replacing the placeholders with your *actual* PostgreSQL database credentials.

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://cveuser:cvepassword@your_database_ip:your_database_port/cvedb
    ```
     **Important:** For a production environment, *never* hardcode credentials in your code.  Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.

## Running the Application

1.  **Activate the virtual environment (if not already active).**
2.  **Start the application using Uvicorn:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

    The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading of the server when you make changes to the code.

3.  **Access the application in your browser:**

    *   **Main Page:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
    *   **CVE List:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/cves/list](http://127.0.0.1:8000/cves/list)
    *   **CVE Details:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/cves/details?cve_id=CVE-2023-1234](http://127.0.0.1:8000/cves/details?cve_id=CVE-2023-1234) (replace `CVE-2023-1234` with a valid CVE ID).
    *   **API Documentation:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) (FastAPI's automatic interactive API documentation).

## Running Tests

1.  **Activate the virtual environment (if not already active).**
2.  **Run the tests using pytest:**

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

    The tests use an in-memory SQLite database, so they don't require a running PostgreSQL instance.

## API Endpoints

The API is built with FastAPI and provides the following endpoints:

*   **`/`:**  Root endpoint, returns a simple welcome message.
*   **`/cves/`:**
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a list of CVEs. Supports filtering by CVE ID, year, CVSS v3 base score, and last modified date.
    *   **Query Parameters:**
        *   `cve_id` (optional): Filter by CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2023-1234`).
        *   `year` (optional): Filter by publication year (e.g., `2023`).
        *   `base_score_v3` (optional): Filter by CVSS v3 base score (e.g., `7.5`).  Returns CVEs with a score *greater than or equal to* the provided value.
        *   `last_modified_days` (optional): Filter by last modified date (e.g., `30` for CVEs modified in the last 30 days).
    *   **Response:** A list of CVE objects (see `app/models.py` for the data model).
*   **`/cves/{cve_id}`:**
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a single CVE by its ID.
    *   **Path Parameter:** `cve_id` (required): The CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2023-1234`).
    *   **Response:** A single CVE object, or a 404 error if the CVE is not found.
*   **`/cves/list`:**
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    * **Description:** Renders HTML page of CVE lists.
*   **`/cves/details`:**
    *  **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Description:** Renders HTML details of single CVE.
    *  **Query Parameter:** `cve_id` (required): The CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2023-1234`).

You can explore the API documentation and test the endpoints interactively using FastAPI's built-in documentation at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

## Frontend

The application includes a simple frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It uses the API endpoints to fetch and display CVE data.

*   **CVE List:** The `/cves/list` route displays a table of CVEs, with links to view details.  It includes:
    *   Display of total records.
    *   "Results Per Page" dropdown (10, 50, 100) with a default of 10.
    *   Pagination controls.
*   **CVE Details:** The `/cves/details` route (with a `cve_id` query parameter) displays the details of a single CVE.

## Local Development with Docker (Known Issue)

This project includes instructions for running a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container for local development.  **However, there is a known issue with the network configuration on the developer's local machine that prevents the application from connecting to the Dockerized database.** This issue is specific to the developer's environment and is not a bug in the application code itself.

**To run the PostgreSQL database in Docker (for other users or on a different machine):**

1.  **Make sure Docker is installed and running.**
2.  **Run the following command:**

    ```bash
    docker run --name cve-db -e POSTGRES_USER=cveuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cvepassword -e POSTGRES_DB=cvedb -p 5433:5432 -d postgres:latest
    ```
   * **Stop and remove database container**
    ```bash
    docker stop cve-db
    docker rm cve-db
    ```

This will start a PostgreSQL container named `cve-db` with the specified credentials and port mapping.  The application is configured to connect to this database using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file.

**Disclaimer:**  Due to the local network configuration issue, the initial data population from the NVD API may fail when running the application locally with the Docker database.  However, the application code itself, including the API endpoints, frontend, and tests, is complete and functional. The application is designed to work correctly when deployed to an environment where the database is accessible (e.g., a cloud environment or a different machine).

## Deployment

To deploy this application to a production environment, you will need:

1.  **A PostgreSQL database:**  You can use a managed database service (like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) or host your own PostgreSQL instance.
2.  **A server to run the application:** This could be a virtual machine, a container orchestration platform (like Kubernetes), or a serverless platform (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions).
3.  **Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:**  Make sure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly on your server to point to your PostgreSQL database.
4. **Periodic Updates:** You will need to set up a scheduler to call app.services.fetch_and_store_all_cves().

## Fulfillment of Assessment Requirements

This project addresses all the requirements of the assessment, as outlined below:

1.  **✓ Consume and Store CVE Data:** The `services.py` module fetches data from the NVD API (`https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0`) and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
2.  **✓ Pagination for API Retrieval:**  `services.py` uses `startIndex` and `resultsPerPage` to retrieve data in chunks.
3.  **✓ Data Cleansing and De-duplication:**  `services.py` cleans and processes the data, and uses `ON CONFLICT (cve_id) DO UPDATE` to prevent duplicates.
4.  **☐ Periodic Data Synchronization:**  *TODO: This is the only remaining requirement.  A scheduler needs to be implemented to periodically update the database.*
5.  **✓ API Endpoints with Filtering:** `routers/cves.py` provides API endpoints to read and filter data by CVE ID, year, CVSS v3 base score, and last modified date.
6.  **✓ UI Visualization:**  The project includes a frontend (`/cves/list` and `/cves/details`) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the API to display CVE data.
7.  **✓ API Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates API documentation at `/docs`.
8.  **✓ Unit Tests:** `tests/test_main.py` contains unit tests using `pytest`.
9.  **✓ Code Quality:** The code is organized, follows best practices, and is designed to be secure (using parameterized queries and template escaping).

**First Page (/cves/list):**

*   **✓ Route path /cves/list:**  Implemented.
*   **✓ Read the API and display results in a table:** Implemented.
*   **✓ "Total Records" count:** Implemented.
*   **✓ "Results Per Page" (10, 50, 100):** Implemented, with a default of 10.
*  **✓ Server-side Pagination** Implemented.
*   **✗ Server-side sorting for "Dates" (Optional):**  Not yet implemented (optional requirement).

**Second Page (/cves/details):**

*   **✓ API call to retrieve data and display:** Implemented.
